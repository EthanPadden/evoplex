/**
 * We need an efficient and simple way to convert enums to strings (vice-versa),
 * many times we also need to catch invalid strings as Invalid. Also, sometimes
 * the string does not reflect the enum name.
 * There are many ways to do that, we have tried Q_ENUM, 'better-enums' and
 * other solutions involving more complex macros, but none worked well here.
 * The decision so far was to use a simple function to handle that. It
 * is a naive solution but it's easier to use and maintain (as long as we
 * don't have big enums).
