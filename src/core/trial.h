 * A trial is part of an experiment which might have several other trials.
 * All trials of an experiment have exactly the same initial conditions,
 * i.e., all attributes and set of nodes are the same.
 *
 * The only difference is that each trial uses a different PRG seed, which
 * is incremented by 1 from the root seed. For exemple, if an experiment
 * seeded with '111' has 3 trials, the seeds of the trials will be '111',
 * '112' and '113'.
